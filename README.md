# SB.js

[SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) in restrictive environments.

## Usage
Userscripts:
  - With Loader (`sb-loader.user.js`)
    - The loader loads the script every time on startup so will update faster and settings are preserved between updates with no intervention.
  - Without Loader (`sb.user.js`)
    - The script will load faster each time, but will require user intervention if any settings are changed

Bookmarklet: `sb.bookmarklet.js`
- Create a new bookmark in your bookmarks bar
- Replace the URL with the text in `sb.bookmarklet.js`

Console: `sb.min.js`
- Copy the contents of `sb.min.js` or `sb.js` into the console
